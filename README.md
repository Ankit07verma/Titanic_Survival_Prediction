Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction with Logistic Regression
This repository explores predicting passenger survival on the Titanic disaster using Logistic Regression, a popular Machine Learning classification technique.

Project Overview
This project aims to:

Load and pre-process the Titanic passenger dataset.
Build a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival based on features like passenger class, age, sex, etc.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Dependencies
This project utilizes several Python libraries for data science tasks:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: Machine Learning algorithms.
Matplotlib/Seaborn (Optional): Data visualization (for exploratory analysis).
Note: Installation instructions for these libraries can be found online.

Usage
Clone this repository.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn).
Run the Jupyter Notebook ([filename].ipynb) or Python script ([filename].py) to execute the data loading, pre-processing, model building, and evaluation steps.
